## Yet another wordclock project

![Image of wordclock](https://github.com/chess-levin/WC64/blob/master/docs/img/wc64_front.jpg)

This is my version of a wordclock. I was trying out the arduino platform and this made so much fun, so I decided to build my own wordclock. The dimensions of my wordclock are approx. 11x11x3 cm. You can clip of the front panel and turn it by 90 degress 
in order to change the posing variant: You can hang the clock on the wall or set it on a shelf. The clock detects
the environment brightness and adapts the brightness of the display to it.

Techically it is based upon an 8x8 LED Matrix (WS2812B LEDs e.g. www.diamex.de), a Real Time Clock and an arduino nano board. In order to set time and date there are two push buttons inside the case. The case is made of wood. The display is a multilayer stack of acralic glass, transparancy film, LED martix and hard foam board. There are some more images, a video and a circuit diagram in the docs folder.

I found several ideas browsing the net for other wordclock projects. Thank you guys - keep on  wordclocking!

Have fun!

Any comments are welcome.
