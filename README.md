## Yet another wordclock project

This is my version of a wordclock. Techically it is based upon an 8x8 LED Matrix (diamex.de) and an arduino nano.

I was trying out the arduino platform and this made so much fun, so I decided to build my own wordclock. 
The dimensions of my wordclock are approx. 11x11x3 cm. You can clip of the front panel and turn it by 90 degress 
in order to change the posing variant: You can hang the clock on the wall or set it on a shelf. The clock detects
the environment brightness and adapts the brightness of the display.

I found several ideas browsing the net for other wordclock projects. Thank you guys!

Any comments are welcome.

Have fun!
